# Project4: Project 4|Simple Login In PHP
Welcome!
This is the repository of my 4th project with Orange Coding Academy. We were required to make a simple registration and login form using PHP. In this project I used Html, CSS and PHP languages only. The website consists of 5 pages: A Landing Page, Sign Up Page, Login Page, Welcoming Page, and An Admin Page that can be accessed only by admin.
